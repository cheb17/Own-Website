		<p><strong>Blackpink</strong> <em>(Hangul: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK)</em> are a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members <em> Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa.</em> They debuted in August 2016 with the single album Square One, which features <em>Whistle</em> and <em>Boombayah</em>, their first number-one hits on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.
		<br><br>
			<strong>Blackpink</strong> are the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 33 with their 2020 singles <em> How You Like That</em> and <em>Sour Candy </em>, and the Billboard 200, peaking at number 24 with <em> Kill This Love</em> (2019). 
		<br><br>
			 They were the first Korean girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart and to top the Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart three times.
	    <br><br>
			 <strong> Blackpink </strong> also became the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their hit single <em>Ddu-Du Ddu-Du</em> (2018), which is the most-viewed music video by a Korean group on YouTube.
		<br><br>
			  They have the most top 40 hits in the United Kingdom among all Korean artists. Their 2018 single <em> Kiss and Make Up</em> was the first-ever song by a Korean group to receive a certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the first-ever song by a Korean group to be certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).
		<br><br>
			  The group has broken numerous online records throughout their career; the music videos for <em>Kill This Love </em>(2019) and <em> How You Like That </em>  each set a record for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release. <em>How You Like That</em> set five total Guinness World Records and became the fastest Korean track to reach double platinum on QQ Music, China's biggest music streaming platform.
		<br><br>
			   <strong>Blackpink's</strong> other accolades include the New Artist of the Year Awards at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards, as well as recognition as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea by Forbes Korea in 2019, and as the first female Korean group on Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia.
		<br><br>
			They are currently the most-followed girl group on Spotify and the most-subscribed music group, female act, and Asian act on YouTube.</p>
